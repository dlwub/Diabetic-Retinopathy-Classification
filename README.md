# Diabetic Retinopathy Classification

📌 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on classifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using the UCI Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen dataset. The dataset consists of features extracted from retinal images, capturing key indicators of diabetic retinopathy. Each instance contains 19 numerical attributes, with the final attribute serving as the target variable:

0 → No diabetic retinopathy (Non-DR case)

1 → Presence of diabetic retinopathy (DR case)

📂 **Dataset**

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Size: 19 numerical features + 1 class label

Task: Binary classification (Non-DR vs. DR)

🛠️ **Machine Learning Models Used**

We implemented and compared three classification algorithms:

**Logistic Regression**

**XGBoost Classifier**

**Random Forest Classifier**

Each model was evaluated using key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in detecting diabetic retinopathy.

⚙️ **Installation & Dependencies**

To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn

**Usage**

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetic-retinopathy-classification.git
cd diabetic-retinopathy-classification

🔥 ** Future Improvements**

Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for better model optimization.

Apply feature engineering to improve classification accuracy.
